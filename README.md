# Connect 4 Game
This is a game based off of connect 4. The original version of this app was made for a technical interview for a job I was applying for at [mosaic manufacturing](https://www.mosaicmfg.com/).

## Limitations

Right now the game is for two human player and doesn't have any win detection. Future versions will add win detection and an AI for single player games. I also can't get the arrow shaped buttons to look quite right.

## How to run
Call
```
npm install
npm start
```
And go to [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
